This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates a RecursionError, a common error in recursive functions.  The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code, which recursively calculates the sum of integers from 0 to x. The issue is a missing condition for halting the recursion for sufficiently large x, leading to stack overflow.  The `bugSolution.py` file demonstrates the solution by adding an appropriate base case and checking for larger inputs before proceeding with recursion to prevent the crash.
